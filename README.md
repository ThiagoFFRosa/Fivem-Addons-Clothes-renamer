these folders renamed leave to the other script to work in the files inside.

in fivem u have the clothes divided in that way

mp_m_freemode_01^lowr_031_u.ydd

in that case u have a multplayer male pants in slot 31 model (ydd) from the game but u need to make it an addon it should be:

mp_m_freemode_01_'the dlc addon u want'^lowr_031_u.ydd

and u have the textutes too:

mp_m_freemode_01_^lowr_diff_031_a_uni.ytd

these are very similar but if u rename these files incorrectly it won't load in the game

soo the second script make that job for u :)
